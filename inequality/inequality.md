# Wealth Inequality

[Wealth Economics](https://www.wealtheconomics.org)

I've been watching this guy on YouTube recently, and have since read his book. A trader for a major bank in Canary Wharf has a very different world view than most, and I think a window into that is useful.

As a reaction to this I'm making a few changes to how I live;

1. I've moved to shopping with Waitrose, who are an employee owned business. [John Lewis Partnership](https://www.johnlewispartnership.co.uk/about/who-we-are.html)
2. I bank with Nationwide, who are member owned. [Nationwide](https://www.nationwide.co.uk/about-us/)
3. ...I need to think of some more ways to not fund the super rich...
