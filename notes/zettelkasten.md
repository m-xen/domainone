# Zettelkasten

I've recently discovered the [Zettelkasten](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/organization/how-to-use-the-zettelkasten-method) method of notetaking.

This is one of the reasons I've started using GitHub Pages to create the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) webpages you are currently browsing. 

The link between them being the [Zettelkasten guide](https://youtu.be/L2z7j7Jho4E?si=III3V-zqcIaMRv71) I found used Obsidian, which uses Markdown.
